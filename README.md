# Advance-House-Price-Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts house prices using advanced regression techniques on the Kaggle House Prices dataset. The project includes data exploration, feature engineering, and model building to accurately estimate sale prices.
House Price Prediction
This project predicts house prices using machine learning. It uses a dataset from Kaggle with information about different houses.

Dataset
The dataset has 1460 houses and 81 features (like size, location, year built, etc.).

You can find the dataset here: Kaggle House Prices Dataset

What this project does
Loads the house data

Analyzes and cleans the data

Builds a model to predict house prices

How to use
